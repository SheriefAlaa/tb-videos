Hello, in this video, we will show you how to get Tor Browser.

The first method is getting Tor Browser from the official website https://torproject.org/

*Opens a web browser (preferably the system's default. If the system is OSX then use Safari) and visits https://torproject.org/*

Hit download Tor Browser then save its cryptographic signature.
