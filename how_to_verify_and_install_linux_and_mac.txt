Hi, in this video we will show you how to verify and install Tor Browser on Mac OS and Linux.

First please make sure you've watched our how to download video to get all the necessary files for this video.

Next, open the torproject website

*opens firefox and visits https://torproject.org/*

Then we will go to the documentation section to take a look on the how to verify page.

*clicks on "Documentation" then "Installation guides" in the side bar then finally chooses "Verify our GPG signatures" and scrolls to the Mac and Linux section*

As the guide stats "You need to have GnuPG (Or GPGTools for Mac OS) before you can verify signatures".

If you are using Linux then you don't need to install GnuPG since your OS will have it installed by default. However, on a Mac, you will need to go to https://gpgtools.org and install it.

Now let's proceed with the verification process by opening a Terminal window.

*opens spotlight and types "terminal" and hits return*

First lets get the Tor Browser developers key by copy pasting this command into the Terminal.

*copies gpg --keyserver x-hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0x4E2C6E8793298290 and pastes it in the terminal then hits enter*

Then, you should see the following...

*shows the verifying signature page and selects the "You should see" portion"*

Finally, before verifying, make sure that all of the necessary files are on your Desktop. The files are TorBrowser.dmg and .asc.

Now let's tell the terminal to change its current working directory or folder to the Desktop using the "cd Desktop" command.

*types cd Desktop in a terminal and hits enter*

To verify, copy the appropriate line for your system, since we're using a Mac, we will copy its line and paste it into the terminal and hit return.

*shows the verifying signature page*
*copies gpg --verify ~/Desktop/TorBrowser-4.5-osx64_en-US.dmg{.asc*,} and pastes into a terminal*

Now you should get a "Good signature from "Tor Browser Developers (signing key) "".

To install Tor Browser on Linux you just have to extract the compressed package. However, on a Mac, must open the .dmg file...

*shows the desktop screen, opens the torbrowser.dmg*

Then drag TorBrowser to the Applications folder..

*drags TorBrowser to the Applications folder*

Now, let's close the installer and eject it.

*closes the installer, shows the desktop and Control clicks the installer then selects "Eject".

Finally you can open Tor Browser from spotlight just like any other application and pin it to your Dock.
